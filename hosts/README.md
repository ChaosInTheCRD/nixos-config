## Tom's use of this folder

This is all definitions of NixOS config for different machines. I plan to use this in the future for a VM and my Desktop, but it's early days and want to get my Macbook nailed with Nix Darwin (`/darwin`) before moving on. Should help me get replication across to NixOS from my MacOS setup when the time comes as well.
