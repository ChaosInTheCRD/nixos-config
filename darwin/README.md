## Tom's use of Darwin

I have modified parts of this, but I am using all of it. Currently I don't have my full set up replicated here, but I am getting there. I hope I will soon get to a point where a new Macbook will just mean popping a shell (in any user), installing Nix and executing the flake. For now though, it works well!
