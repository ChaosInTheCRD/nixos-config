# Tom's use of Shells!

This is another thing that I look forward to using when the time comes. You can define shells here and then you can execute them to bring up a shell with all the packages and configuration within them. The exact correct packages with the exact right versions, all the environment variables you ever wished for, whatever you want. What is not to like!

At some point I will personalise all this to me but for now, I am not using them.
